This file describes what each idea/test covers

File:
singlechannelmlp.py
Idea:
aims to test how well an autoregresive MLP with fixed window size does compared to guessing the average
Result:
Meh, does better than guessing, but not by much. Perhaps smoothing the data would help, i imagine extreme outliers would make this a harder problem.

File:
singlechannelsmoothedmlp.py
Idea: 
Same thing as singlechannelmlp.py, but smoothed to make the next item in the sequence more reasonable.
Result: 
Not much improvement, the overall MSE improves for both but the difference isn't significant

File: autoenc.py
Idea: Test how well autoencoders do on the entire sequence
Result: Pretty good result, I should set an "ideal number" that allows us to encode the residual within the constraints.

File: autoenc.py
Idea: Maybe autoencoders work better on less jagged data, so we should smooth the data first
Result: Still good results, but suprisingly little auteoncoder improvement
