Goal: Predict several components of a multi-channel, high sampling rate, multi-timestep singlechannelmlp

Ideas:
- These are signals, so they have repetitive components
- Predict across time, across channels
- Skip/pool some points (not effective for lossless compression on second thought)
- Ideally, we have an adaptive bitwise autoencoder
